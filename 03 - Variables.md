# Variables

Variables are like containers which can be used to store data and used later.

## Naming a variable

You can name your variable whatever you want but there are certain restrictions to naming in C.

- Variable names are case sensitive i.e `x` is different than `X`.
- The number of letters in a variable should not exceed 31 letters.
- You can add numbers to variable however the name of the variable should always start with a letter.
- `_` (underscore) is counted as a letter.
- The variable name should not be a reserved keyword.
