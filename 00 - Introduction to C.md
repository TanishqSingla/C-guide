### What is C
As mentioned in K&R\
*"C is a general-purpose programming language which features economy of expression, modern control flow and data structures and rich set of operators."*\
This basically translates to a high level language but C was not aimed to be a "very high level" language like python and it was made on the principle "trust the programmer", what this means that C would let you do anything without any restrictions.
